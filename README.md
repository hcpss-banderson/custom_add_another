Custom add another
==================

This is a very simple module that allows you to customise the text of the 'Add another item' button on multi-valued fields.

If your field supports 'unlimited' values then you are offered the option of customising the 'Add another item' button text. This setting is stored per 'bundle', so you can have different button text if you use the same field in two places.

Examples
--------

* On an image field, you may want to 'Add another image'.
* On a field called 'highlights' you may want to 'Add another highlight'.
